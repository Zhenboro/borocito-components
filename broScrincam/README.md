## About
Dedicated to recording the screen, taking screenshots from a webcam, recording the desktop, among other similar functions.  
This plugin is for:  
- Take photos from a Webcam  
- Record video from a Webcam (not coded yet)  
- Record microphone  
- Streaming the microphone
- Record screen (it should work)  
*The function to record the screen should work, but in my case the server does NOT allow uploading the recording file because it is very large*  
 
>Single Instance Package  
## Usage

**Start screen recording:**
```sh
/startscreenrecording: Will start to record the screen.
boro-get broScrincam True /startscreenrecording
```  
**Stop screen recording:**
```sh

**Start webcam recording:**
First, you must select a webcam to be able to use it. The command:  
```sh
/getcameras
```  
It will return an integer and the MonkierString separated by a |. Then, you can select the camera with the command:  
```sh
/camera <cameraIndex>
```  
An example will be:  
```sh
/getcameras
```  
```sh
	Return
		0|WebCam Name here|@device:sw:{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}
		1|Another camera|@device:sw:{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}
		3|OBS Virtual Camera|@device:sw:{860BB310-5D01-11D0-BD3B-00A0C911CE86}\{A3FCE0F5-3493-419F-958A-ABA1250EC20B}
```  
Then, select a camera:  
```sh
/camera <cameraIndex>
	Ex.:
		/camera 0
	Return
		Camera 0 is now True (True = Active)
		Camera 0 is now False (False = No Active Xd)
```  
Then, and finally, you can use the `/TakeCamPicture` command.  

**For return strings, [boro-hear](https://github.com/Zhenboro/borocito-components/blob/dev/boro-hear/README.md) must be installed.**

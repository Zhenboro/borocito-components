Complementos/Plugins/Componentes para Borocito CLI  

## Complements
These plugins were created to enrich the experience with BorocitoCLI.  

They're not perfect, but they're not disappointing either. Well, it really depends on how they're made. I invite you to contribute to the development of these, if there is something, an error, bug, an idea, etc, contribute, I will greatly appreciate it, and those of us who use these complements too.  

### Using it
All plugins present here were originally created by [Zhenboro](https://github.com/Zhenboro). And for its use, it is vital and mandatory to use boro-get, it must be installed in order to use and manage the plugins mentioned here.  
boro-get is a module within BorocitoCLI. It's totally inside, well implemented. So, initially, there should be no problem.  

### About
BORO-GET tries to solve the following problem: Avoid over-loading the distributable executable. In addition, this gives freedom to create your own supplements and install them remotely. Total control. If you need a function, you can program it and implement it for yourself.  
Not only that, we also avoid the signature of the antivirus. Well, for example, Brokiloger is very suspicious, it is a keys recorder. Thus the antivirus could only block that complement, but, not the instance of Borocito.

### Repository
On the server, the Boro-Get folder is where everything boro-get will use.
You can leave the files that are within boron-get as they were when you downloaded them, this will make my repository be used located in my inventible "chemic-jug" server.   
Also, if you want my server to provide you with the repository, you must modify the file 'GlobalSettingS.ini' that is in the Borocito Server-side root folder.   

I really recommend you use my repository, upload updates with improvements, etc. So you avoid having to update your repository.  

**Remember: it's just a repository. I can not steal the victims and either receive files either. It's just read-only**
